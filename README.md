TODO: the entire project idk

audio-player, idk play audio
TUI application written in rust

Crates:
Ratatui - TUI crate (Crossterm Backend)
CPAL - Audio backend stuff?
Symphonia - Importing many audio formats probably
Color Eyre - Idk I though why not try out colorful panic messages
Tokio - Async, always gotta have async its good but sometimes makes things a pain but usually pros > cons

welcome to my (probably) biggest project
hope this one doesnt die like the other did
if it doesnt then this will be my great audio/music player as an alternative to youtube
its a thing to store songs and play them, not to find them, thats the job of like youtube or spotify or whatever else you use
